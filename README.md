# EnsureValidPayRate
Basic C# Console program using if-else statements to make decisions.

A program that prompts the user for an hourly pay rate. If the user enters value less than $5.65 or greater then $49.99, prompt the user again. If the user enters a valid value on either the first and second attempt, display the pay rate as well as the weekly rate, which is calculated as 40 times the hourly rate.
